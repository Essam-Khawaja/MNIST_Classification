# MNIST Digit Classification with Deep Neural Network

A deep learning project that classifies handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset using a fully connected neural network. Built to demonstrate core machine learning skills including data preprocessing, model design, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Overview

This project applies a feedforward deep neural network (DNN) to the MNIST dataset—a benchmark dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels). The model is trained to achieve high classification accuracy using modern deep learning techniques.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- TensorFlow

## Model Architecture

- Input Layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixels flattened)
- Hidden Layers: Example - 50 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output Layer: 10 neurons with Softmax activation

**Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy  
**Optimizer**: Adam (or whichever you used)  
**Evaluation Metric**: Accuracy

## Results

- Final Validation Accuracy: **97.13%%**
- Confusion Matrix and Sample Predictions included
- Plots for training and validation loss and accuracy

## Learning Goals

This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and standardization
- Neural network design, training, and evaluation
- Visualization of model performance
- Practical use of deep learning libraries for supervised classification
